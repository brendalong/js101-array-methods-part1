#JS101 Array Methods Part 1

* toString() - convert array to string
* join() - like toString() but add a separator
* pop() - remove last item
* shift() - remove first item
* push() - add item to end of array
* unshift() - add item to front of array
* splice(x, y, items) - add elements to array. x is starting position, y is elements to remove, and then items to add (separated by a comma)
* splice(x, y) - remove element from array without leaving holes. x is starting position and y is howmany to remove.
* concat() - join two arrays
* slice(x) - slice out part of an array into another. x is where to start. Original array stays intact
* slice(x, y) - only slice part of an array. Beginning and ending position (does not include ending position)
